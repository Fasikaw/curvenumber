Return periods are then matched using the Frequency Matching approach [Hjelmfelt (1980)](http://cedb.asce.org/cgi/WWWdisplay.cgi?9734). \r\n\r\n```R\r\ndf  <- EventIdentification(dataX = InputTS,\r\n                           hours2extend = 6, plotOption = FALSE,\r\n                           stepsBack = 5, timeUnits = \"hours\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Calculate the Curve Number\r\nDetermine the Curve Number and k coefficient and also plot CN-P behaviour to \r\ndefine the type of asymptote\r\n```R\r\ncoef <- CalculateCN(dfTPQ = df, PQunits = \"mm\", plotOption = TRUE)\r\n```\r\n\r\nPlease note that there are three types of behaviour: \r\n* \"standard\" (increasing asymptotically), \r\n* \"complacent\" (decreasing indefinitely) and \r\n* \"violent\" (increasing asymptotically).\r\nHere, only the standard behaviour is implemented. In this case, CN (infinity) is\r\nthe value of CN that corresponds to the largest rainfall events and can be \r\ncalculated by a nonlinear least squares curve fitting (red line).\r\n\r\n#### Warnings\r\nThis package and functions herein are provided as is, without any guarantee.\r\n\r\n#### Please leave your feedback\r\nThis package was developed by [Claudia Vitolo](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/c.vitolo) and [Nataliya Le Vine](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/n.le-vine).
